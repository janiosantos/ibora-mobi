/**
 * A vertex that represents an OSM elevator node in conjunction with a connected OSM entity. This
 * class can almost be described as representing one level of an elevator vertex. However, due to
 * a lack of level information in OSM for entities connected to an elevator node, going by the data
 * means that two of these vertices could be on the same level.
 * <p>
 * Two OSM elevator vertices on the same level need to be separate! The reason for this is that
 * traversing an elevator node only makes sense if you use the elevator. Having a shared elevator
 * vertex with entities on the same level creates a teleportation device from one level to another
 * with bad data.
 * <p>
 * This is a separate class in order to conserve memory as only a tiny percentage of vertices
 * actually has level information.
