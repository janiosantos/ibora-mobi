/**
 * Represents a driver's carpool journey with planned route, timing, and passenger capacity.
 * <p>
 * A carpool trip models a driver offering their vehicle journey for passengers to join. It includes
 * the driver's planned route as a sequence of stops, available seating capacity, and timing
 * constraints including a deviation budget that allows the driver to slightly adjust their route
 * to accommodate passengers.
 *
 * <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Origin/Destination Areas:</strong> Start and end zones for the driver's journey</li>
 *   <li><strong>Stops:</strong> Ordered sequence of waypoints along the route where passengers
 *       can be picked up or dropped off. Stops are dynamically updated as bookings occur.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Deviation Budget:</strong> Maximum additional time the driver is willing to spend
 *       to pick up/drop off passengers (e.g., 5 minutes). This represents the driver's flexibility.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Available Seats:</strong> Current passenger capacity remaining in the vehicle</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Data Source</h2>
 * <p>
 * Trips are typically created from SIRI-ET messages provided by external carpooling platforms.
 * The platform manages driver registrations, trip creation, and real-time updates as passengers
 * book or cancel rides.
 *
 * <h2>Immutability</h2>
 * <p>
 * CarpoolTrip instances are immutable. Updates to trip state (e.g., adding a booked passenger)
 * require creating a new trip instance via {@link CarpoolTripBuilder} and upserting it to the
 * {@link org.opentripplanner.ext.carpooling.CarpoolingRepository}.
 *
 * <h2>Usage in Routing</h2>
 * <p>
 * The routing algorithm uses trips to find compatible matches for passenger requests:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Filters check basic compatibility (capacity, timing, direction)</li>
 *   <li>Insertion strategy finds optimal pickup/dropoff positions along the route</li>
 *   <li>Validators ensure constraints (capacity timeline, deviation budget) are satisfied</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * @see CarpoolStop for individual stop details
 * @see CarpoolTripBuilder for constructing trip instances
 * @see org.opentripplanner.ext.carpooling.updater.SiriETCarpoolingUpdater for trip updates
